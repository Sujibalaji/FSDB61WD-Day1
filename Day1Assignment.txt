1.Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2
HTTP1.1:
    -It works on the textual format.
    -There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
    -It compresses data by itself.
 HTTP2:
    -It works on the binary protocol.
    -It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    -It uses HPACK for data compression.

 2.Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:
     
       - A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.
       - A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
       - Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. 
       - The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. 
       - You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:

                  objectName.propertyName
 Example:
              var myCar = new Object();
              myCar.make = 'Ford';
              myCar.model = 'Mustang';
              myCar.year = 1969;
